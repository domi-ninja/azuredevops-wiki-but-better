# project description

this is a clone of azure devops wiki, which is cool because we can use git commit the changes and push them back to the real devops

- markdown files and folders make the wiki structure
- ordering of subfolders and files can optionally be customized in a file called `.order`.
- If files or folder in the dir a missing from `.order`, they are added
- Check `..\Aurora.wiki\` for real world example of a wiki
- Tree style navivation on the left of the page
- WSIWYG md editing
- Images get uploaded to project root, `.attachments` and linked like this `![image.png](/.attachments/image-1a2e3d6c-b2b7-4e32-827c-3da5bf7d212f.png)`


## tech 

- nodejs express local server
- typescript vite react frontend
- config file with the loaded project path `..\Aurora.wiki\`
