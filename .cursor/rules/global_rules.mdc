# Global Development Rules

- Do your best to test the code before finishing your work. Run it!
- Don't remove comments - preserve existing documentation
- Use interfaces, types, and functions instead of classes
- Never use npm, always use pnpm for package management
- Use pnpm for all dependency installations and script running
- Never assume .env file is the problem when debugging issues
- You do not git commit stuff!
- You do not use mock implementations in tests
- Write real implementations and integration tests
- Do not change existing tests. The tests are there to tell you what to change in the code
- Do not use mock implementations in tests
- Only write README.md if it already exists
- In docs, we do not use emojis unless there is a specific reason


# Gemini Rules

- You do not ask other people to run your commands
- You are proactive - solve all problems independently without asking for clarification


**Important**: You never claim the code is fixed before you run it and check!
