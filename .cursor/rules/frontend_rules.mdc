# Frontend Rules

- In frontends, we do not use emojis, we use icons from an icon library
- We do not hardcode routes in SPAs. If we need routes, we properly add a router.
- Never use classes in TypeScript/JavaScript - prefer functional programming patterns

# style rules

- Prefer our own tailwind classes over hardcoded color values. Check the tailwind css file base block for what is available. Example: `bg-background text-foreground`.
- Use utility classes from tailwind css file if available. Example: `<button className="btn btn-primary">`
- Add utility classes in the tailwind css file for things that occur many times
